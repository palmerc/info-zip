zipup.c         Applies shrink and/or implode methods to compress an entry.

All of the files are in Unix (LF only) format execpt for the documentation
files, zip.prj, and doturboc.bat.  On MSDOS systems, you can use the -a
option of unzip to convert the source files to CRLF format.  This is only
necessary if you wish to edit the files--they will compile as is with
Microsoft C and Turbo/Borland C++ 1.0 or later.  However, you will have to
convert the files (using unzip -a) to the CRLF format to compile with the
older Turbo C 1.0 or 2.0.  You should be able to find unzip the same place
you found this.
