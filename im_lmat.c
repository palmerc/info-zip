 *
 *  PURPOSE
 *
 *      Identify new text as repetitions of old text within a fixed-
 *      length sliding window trailing behind the new text.
 *
 *  DISCUSSION
 *
 *      The "implosion" process depends on being able to identify portions
 *      of the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a
 *      sliding window trailing behind the input currently being processed).
 *
 *      The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
 *      most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
 *      The key feature is of this algorithm is that insertion and deletions
 *      from the string dictionary are very simple and thus fast. Insertions
 *      and deletions are performed at each input character, whereas string
 *      matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it is
 *      preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
 *      insertions and deletions. The matching algorithm for small strings
 *      is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach is
 *      used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
 *      A similar algorithm is used in freeze (by Leonid Broukhis) but the
 *      algorithm used here is faster.
 *         A previous version of this file used a more sophisticated algorithm
 *      (by Fiala and Greene) which is guaranteed to run in linear amortized
 *      time, but has a larger average cost and uses more memory. However
 *      the F&G algorithm may be faster for some highly redundant files if
 *      the parameter max_chain_length (described below) is too large.
 *
 *  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 *
 *      Rich Wales defined the interface, provided the necessary information
 *      to ensure compatibility with pkunzip 1.0 (not an easy job) and
 *      suggested the solution (n == 1 + n-1) adopted here.
 *      The idea of lazy evaluation of matches is due to Jan Mark Wams, and
 *      I found it in 'freeze' written by Leonid Broukhis.
 *      Special thanks to Kai-Uwe Rommel for the OS/2 port, to Glenn J.
 *      Andrews for the VMS port, and to many other info-zippers for testing.
